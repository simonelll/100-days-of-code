# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
This is my JS course assignment & I worked a whole day for that.
Worked on inserting JSON into JS & HTML today. Used handlebar.js & a local server for JSON. 
The console works well but I don't know why my JSON file cannot show on my page. 

**Thoughts:** 
There're three ways to insert JSON into JS & HTML(XMLHTTPRequest, AJAX, Jquery). I need to read books about DOM/JQUERY/JSON/API and HTTP Basics.
Remote coding is hard. I need to reach out more actively.

### Day 2: November 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: This is my another JS course assignment & I worked for 1 hour. This uses a simple lyrics-generator API to generate songs of Coldplay.

**Thoughts**: This is a really easy one, quite rough. I'll work on this more.
