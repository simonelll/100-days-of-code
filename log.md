# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
This is my JS course assignment & I worked a whole day for that.
Worked on inserting JSON into JS & HTML today. Used handlebar.js & a local server for JSON. 
The console works well but I don't know why my JSON file cannot show on my page. 

**Thoughts:** 
There're three ways to insert JSON into JS & HTML(XMLHTTPRequest, AJAX, Jquery). I need to read books about DOM/JQUERY/JSON/API and HTTP Basics.
Remote coding is hard. I need to reach out more actively.

### Day 2: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
